# Neovim Config

This is my personal configuration for neovim. Changes are still ongoing and things will change as I start to play around with mapping and lsp options for different development purposes.

# Features

- Rust Analyzer
- Visual Debugger

# Quick Install

```bash
# git clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:Thissutek/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
